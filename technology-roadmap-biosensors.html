        </div>

        <h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction</h2>
        <div><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Biosensors are analytical devices that combine a biological component with a physicochemical detector to detect and quantify a specific analyte. They are used in a wide range of applications, including medical diagnosis, environmental monitoring, and food safety.</p>

<h3>Working Principle</h3>
<p>The working principle of biosensors involves the interaction between a biological recognition element (such as an enzyme, antibody, or DNA) and a target analyte. This interaction generates a signal that is transduced by a physicochemical detector (such as an electrochemical, optical, or piezoelectric sensor) into a measurable output. The biological recognition element is immobilized on a transducer surface, which allows for the selective detection of the target analyte in a complex sample matrix. The sensitivity and specificity of biosensors depend on the affinity and selectivity of the biological recognition element, as well as the sensitivity and stability of the physicochemical detector. Biosensors offer several advantages over traditional analytical methods, including real-time monitoring, high sensitivity, and low sample volume requirements.</p></div>

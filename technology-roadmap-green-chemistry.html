        </div>

        <h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction</h2>
        <div><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Green chemistry is a branch of chemistry that focuses on the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. It aims to promote sustainability and minimize the negative impact of chemical products and processes on human health and the environment.</p>

<h3>Working Principle</h3>
<p>The principles of green chemistry include the use of renewable resources, the design of safer chemicals and processes, the reduction of waste and energy consumption, and the use of catalysts to increase efficiency and selectivity. Green chemistry also involves the use of alternative solvents, such as water, and the development of biodegradable and non-toxic products. The goal of green chemistry is to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical industry that benefits both society and the planet.</p></div>
